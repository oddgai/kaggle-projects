        ### Objective
        Create a baseline model for podcast listening time prediction using LightGBM.
        
        ### Key Insights
        1. Episode length is by far the most predictive feature
        2. New feature Ad_Density (ads per minute) is highly effective 
        3. Host and guest popularity are moderately important
        4. Model shows good generalization (CV ≈ Public ≈ Private scores)
        
        ### Feature Engineering Successes
        - Ad_Density: Simple but effective ratio feature
        - Has_Guest: Binary flag for guest presence
        - Host_Guest_Popularity_Diff: Difference in popularity scores
        
        ### Model Performance
        - Stable across CV folds (std = 0.02)
        - No signs of overfitting
        - R² = 0.77 indicates good predictive power
        
        ### Areas for Improvement
        1. Target encoding could help with high-cardinality categoricals
        2. Feature interactions not fully explored
        3. Hyperparameter tuning potential
        4. Ensemble opportunities
